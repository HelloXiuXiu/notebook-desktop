# Migration from v11 to v12

There was a breaking change in dialog.

You now have to `const { TonicDialog } = require('@socketsupply/components/dialog')`
The class was renamed from `Dialog` => `TonicDialog`.

The dialog class was also rewritten.

# Migration from v10 to v11

`@socketsupply/components` now depends on `@socketsupply/tonic@13`

There's a breaking change in `tonic-input`. It used to support
HTML in the `label=...` attribute. Now it only supports text
content.

# Migration from v9 to v10

We made a breaking change to `tonic-chart`. Previously it had
an optional dependency on `chart.js`

Now you need to set the dependency manually like

```html
<tonic-chart
  type="horizontalBar""
  chart-library="${require('chart.js')}"
  src="/chartdata.json"
></tonic-chart>
```

Or

```js
const chart = document.querySelector('tonic-chart')
chart.setChart(require('chart.js'))
```

If you do not use `tonic-chart` then the upgrade is safe.

# Migration from v8 to v9

`@socketsupply/components` now depends on `@socketsupply/tonic@12`

You need to upgrade tonic to use v9 of components

# Migration from v7 to v8

`@socketsupply/components` now depends on `@socketsupply/tonic@11`

You need to upgrade tonic to use v8 of components
